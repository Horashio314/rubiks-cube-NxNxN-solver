- IDA should be fast enough for tsai 555 now
    - when staging FB do so such that LR is 432ed...we should get this almost for free
      and while the LR centers will be somewhat undone in the next phase it should still
      make the next phase a little faster.

- 666 UD and FB centers could be staged in a single phase (no need
      to pair oblique edges here)

- 666 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- 777 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?
