- IDA should be fast enough for tsai 555 now

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

    - pairing the last eight edges should be doable with IDA-via-graph.  Build a HighWingMidge
      table and a LowWingMidge table, I think each of those will be 8! or 40,320. The centers
      table should be 6 * 6 * 4900 = 176,400 states.

      There is some bug here I cannot figure out.  To troubleshoot it I am rebuilding the
      821 million entry "pair last eight edges" table.  Once that is done find the solution
      for the last 8 edges at the end of phase5 and feed that into IDA-via-graph and see
      what the two pt costs are. There is also something funky happening when I try to use
      the old way of solving, I see a ton of

state_to_find QOqpPRYQryRP------------WWowXXZYxzZO, hash_raw 3819963987. hash_index 568559111, result is 0

      These should be pretty rare...maybe the hash algorithm has changed? This makes it pretty
      much impossible to use any HashCostOnly approach I think.

      delete without_LFRB and LookupTable555XPlaneYPlaneEdgesOrientPairOneEdge once you
      have this figured out.


- 666 UD and FB centers could be staged in a single phase (no need
      to pair oblique edges here)

- 666 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- 777 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- IDAViaGraph cleanup
    - drop linecount, filesize and the main table from __init__
