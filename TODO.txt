- IDA should be fast enough for tsai 555 now

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

    - pairing the last eight edges should be doable with IDA-via-graph.  Build a HighWingMidge
      table and a LowWingMidge table, I think each of those will be 8! or 40,320. The centers
      table should be 6 * 6 * 4900 = 176,400 states.

- 666 UD and FB centers could be staged in a single phase (no need
      to pair oblique edges here)

- 666 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- 777 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- IDAViaGraph cleanup
    - drop linecount, filesize and the main table from __init__
