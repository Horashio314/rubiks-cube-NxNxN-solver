    --fast could be a mirror of how 555 edge solver works

    - phase3 is "slow" (takes about 3s). Am currently building the LR centers + midges table
      that should speed it up. Will it then be fast enough for us to solve all 2048 EO permutations?
      If so that might reduce the move count for phase3 (currently takes ~12 moves). If it is
      too slow for that one extreme option would be to use a perfect-hash to build the full EO
      table.  That would be 2,704,156 * 2,048 = 5,538,111,488 entries though, that might take
      months to build.  Or maybe we just IDA all of them? Even if you could do 100 of them per-sec
      it would take 640 days!!

      See how fast phase3 is after the LR centers + midges table then re-evaluate.

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

    - phase4 could be much faster via perfect hash of FB-centers + high midges and FB-center + low midges.
      Each of these would be 117,600 * 4,900 = 576,240,000.  The first of these is building now
      on LJ's machine. This should allow us to drop the ThreeEdges hack.

    - The phase where we stage the UD centers (LR centers have already been done) should
      be moved to ida_search.c.
