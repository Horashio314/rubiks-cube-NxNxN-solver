DONE - remove max_depth everywhere
DONE - remove prune_table boolean? I don't think this is used
- build these deeper and convert to .bin file using pack()
    - 4x4x4-ULFRBD-centers-stage - currently 6-deep
    - 5x5x5-UD-centers-stage - currently 6-deep
    - 5x5x5-LR-centers-stage would be 165 million so uses IDA...could probably build all 165million via .bin and avoid IDA here
    - 6x6x6-UD-oblique-edge-pairing - currently 6-deep
    - 6x6x6-LR-oblique-edge-pairing would be 165 million so uses IDA...could probably build all 165million via .bin and avoid IDA here


DONE - build 5x5x5-ULFRBD-centers-solve deeper? I built a much better prune table
- build 6x6x6-LFRB-solve-inner-x-center-and-oblique-edges deeper?  Need a clever way to compress it




solutions.html
DONE - need an arrow that loads the next step of instructions
- highlight the face/rows that you should be turning
- have a play/pause button so that it auto increments every 5s


444 solver
- look into the 52 moves tables xyzzy is using


NNN solver
- work on centers for 14x14x14


DONE - rotate_xxx() can we compress the lists down to a few lists additions?
same for state_functions


4x4x4 Tsai...could we combine first two phases?
        If you solved LR from the start that table would have 24!/(4!*4!*16!) or 51482970
        If you stage UD and FB from the start that table would be 24!/(8!*8!*8!) or 9465511770
        If you solved LR and stage UD and FB from the start that table would be 24!/(4!*4!*8!*8!) or 662585823900
        The orient_table has 2704156

        The main table would be 24!/(4!*4!*8!*8!) * 2704156 or 1791735431214128400
        51482970/1791735431214128400     is 0.0000000000287336 so that would be very very slow
        9465511770/1791735431214128400   is 0.0000000052828736 so that might be doable but this is borderline
            but requires you to build a prune table that is 9.4 billion entries
        662585823900/1791735431214128400 is 0.0000003698011505 so that would work
            but requires you to build a prune table that is 662 billion entries
