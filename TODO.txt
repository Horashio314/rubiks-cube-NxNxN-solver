- get the IDA speed improvement stuff in master
    - as part of this finish the experiment to combine 444 phase1+2
      Currently am rebuilding the tables with the Lw, etc "can skip these" moves removed
      If this fails then just redo phase1 to use the new IDA, assuming that doesn't
      use too much memory.  The current IDA for this phase is pretty fast already.
    - can we get rid of the --fast code path...or at least simplify it?

- IDA should be fast enough for tsai 555 now
    - merge in the code to stage LR centers first
    - when we are staging the UD centers go ahead and solve the LR centers? That
      shouldn't take many more moves and would allow us to do just straight lookups
      for the EO phase.

- 666 UDand FB centers could be staged in a single phase (no need
      to pair oblique edges here).  This assumes the code to stage
      LR centers first is in.

- 666 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?

- 777 now that IDA is much faster does that change anything?


optimal 333 (without L L' R R')
-------------------------------
Something to think about here is if the edges are EOed to their final orientation
then it might be feasible to solve 333 optimally since L L' R R' will not be required.
There would be 239,500,800 edge states and 88,179,840 million corner states.

weird 18 is the normal average for an optimal 333 solver that is surprising I
would have thought this would be lower. So whether or not to EO the edges to
their final orientation really depends on if you could get this 333 optimal
solver to run quickly enough.  There are far too many states for us to use 
the IDA-graph approach. Both of those prune tables would be pretty deep I
imagine so that would help.  Who knows this might be feasible.
