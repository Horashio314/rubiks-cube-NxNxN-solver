- clean up any "dummy" references

- 444 --fast could be a mirror of how 555 edge solver works

- IDA should be fast enough for tsai 555 now

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

- 666
    - The phase where we stage the UD centers (LR centers have already been done) should
      be moved to ida_search.c.

- rm RubiksCube555ForNNN.py
