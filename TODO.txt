    --fast could be a mirror of how 555 edge solver works

    - do the new EO stuff avoid OLL?  The last 8 edges are not pairing I bet I broke OLL.

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

    - phase4 could be much faster via perfect hash of FB-centers + high midges and FB-center + low midges.
      Each of these would be 117,600 * 4,900 = 576,240,000.  The first of these is building now
      on LJ's machine. This should allow us to drop the ThreeEdges hack.
