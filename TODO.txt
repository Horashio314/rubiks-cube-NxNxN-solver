    --fast could be a mirror of how 555 edge solver works

    - the phase4 table has all 121,287,375 entries.  If we kept only up to depth-3 that would
      cut it to about 30 million and would be plenty deep. Or we start storing everything in
      an s3 bucket and stop worrying about large files. Honestly we could probably only keep
      up to depth-2 and that would be enough. Figure this out after the phase5 edges table
      has finished building.

- We can currently only get the daisy pattern on FB. LR we could certain do but then to
do UD and FB at once would be a 70^10 search space which would be HUGE.
